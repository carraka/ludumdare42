[1]	Guinevere and Lancelet live some bit aways from the kingdom of... Arthur! They have a daughter and a pair of twins. But one day Lancelet gets called for by none other than Arthur himself to help him fight against the Gallic Empire. Reluctantly, Guinevere lets him go with a parting gift of locks of her hair from her armpits.
